## Review
1. What is your favorite CS topic you've learned so far?

I enjoyed learning about while loops and for loops last semester. Also, we got to build a personal website last semester using Python, GitHub, and CSS, and it was a lot of fun. My older family members know nothing about computer science, so I showed them my website and they were super impressed! I also like the idea of filtering a large data set to the most relevant data using while loops and for loops and nested loops. 

## Exploration
2. What is the most difficult CS topic you've learned so far?

I felt that I did not fully grasp nested loops for a while. I had trouble understanding how a loop within a loop could work. But I feel like I understand them better now, after a few explanation videos on the topic. (Thank you kahn academy : ) 

## Challenge
3. What do you most look forward to learning this semester?
I am completing this worksheet shortly after having watched the video and read the article about the Java Memory Model and Java Virtual Machine and Hardwear Memory Architecture, so I am really looking forward to learning more about how code interacts with hardwear. My grandpa was an engineer since the early 60s so he talks about early computers, and I want to tell him what I have learned about how code interracts with modern computers.
